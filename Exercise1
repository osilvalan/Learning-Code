# Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age.
# Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
# Extras:
#    Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the
# previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
#    Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing
# the ENTER button)

name = input("Qual o seu nome? ")
age = int(input("Qual a sua idade? "))

hund = int((2020 - age) +100)

x = int(input("Quantas vezes deve repetir? "))

print ("Seu nome é %s e você tem %s anos.\nE completará 100 anos em %s\n" % (name, age, hund)* x)
